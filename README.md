# Program Manager *II* for Windows NT
![Progmgr banner](/misc/pman2.png)

## What is Program Manager?
Program Manager was the default shell for Windows (NT) 3.x. The Program Manager shell was included as an optional component in Windows until Windows 2000. It contained a basic task manager, a group-based program launcher and a shutdown dialog.

## So, Program Manager II?
Program Manager II is a shell designed to supercede the original Microsoft Program Manager with better compatibility, stability, and ease of usage. It's currently in alpha and doesn't contain all of the necessary functionality, but progress is being made.

## What does it run on?
Program Manager II will run on Windows Vista and above with no problem. Support for XP and older is not guaranteed, nor will it be ported to 9x.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](https://github.com/Vortesys/Program-Manager-II/releases) will contain the latest "stable" version of Program Manager II. Build artifacts can be found for most commits made since April and contain pre-release builds.
