# Program Manager *II* for Windows NT
![Progman banner](/misc/banner.png)

## What is Program Manager?
Program Manager was the shell that shipped with Microsoft Windows by default from Windows 3.0/NT 3.1 to 3.11/NT 3.51. The Program Manager shell was included with Windows as an option until Windows 2000. The new Program Manager is a shell that aims to mimic the original desktop metaphor that the original Program Manager was designed for while adding modern amenities.

## What does it run on?
Program Manager should run on every AMD64 version of Windows and every 32-bit version back to 2000. The ultimate goal is to run on NT 3.51 just as well as it can run on Windows 11
